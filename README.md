# PHP Project
This project was designed to help me learn PHP by building an interactive website that uses HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript/AJAX, and a MySQL database to provide advanced, interactive functionality to users. The project involves the creation and integration of a MySQL database with four tables: Users, News, Customers and Projects. The database must be exported in SQL and attached to the project.

## Description
  1. **Development of an Interactive Website**: The main objective is to create an interactive website that uses HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript/AJAX and a MySQL database to provide advanced and interactive functionalities to users.
  2. **Inclusion of a Database**: The project involves the creation and integration of a MySQL database with four tables: Users, News, Customers and Projects. The database must be exported in SQL and attached to the project.
  3. **Authentication and Privacy System**: Implement a user authentication system, where only registered users can access certain areas of the website. Additionally, create an administrative tab visible only to administrators, allowing you to modify aspects of the site and database tables.
  4. **User Registration and Password Encryption**: Develop a registration form that collects user information and inserts it into the corresponding table in the database. Passwords must be stored securely, ideally using advanced encryption techniques.

Final Result: Ensure that the project works without errors, both in terms of functionality and security.
These objectives reflect the project goals of including a database in a website and creating a dynamic and interactive web application that meets users' needs, both in terms of functionality.
